# Processes and Signals

## Overview
This project focuses on the management of processes and signals in Linux. It aims to deepen the understanding of process identification (PID), process handling, and signal management.

## Learning Objectives
- **General Concepts**: Understanding what a PID is, how to find and kill a process, and the nature of signals, including those that cannot be ignored.
- **Bash Projects**: All projects will be auto-corrected with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, and Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck without errors.

## Requirements
- Use editors like `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`.
- Scripts should be executable and begin with `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
- Include a `README.md` at the root of the project directory.

## Tasks
1. **What is my PID**: Write a script that displays its own PID.
2. **List your processes**: Display a list of currently running processes[^1^][1].
3. **Show your Bash PID**: Script to display lines containing the word 'bash'.
4. **To infinity and beyond**: A script that prints a message indefinitely with a pause.
5. **Don't stop me now!**: A script to stop the above script using `kill`.
6. **Stop me if you can**: Similar to task 5 but without using `kill` or `killall`.
