# Regular Expression Project

## Overview
This project focuses on building regular expressions using the Oniguruma library, which is the default in Ruby. The goal is to create Ruby scripts that accept arguments and pass them to a regular expression matching method.


## Concepts
- **Regular Expression**: Understanding the basics and advanced usage of regular expressions is crucial for this project.

## Requirements
- **Environment**: Scripts will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- **Execution**: All Bash script files must be executable with the first line `#!/usr/bin/env ruby`.
- **Regex Library**: All regex must be built for the Oniguruma library.

## Tasks
1. **Simply Matching School**: Create a script that matches the word "School".
2. **Repetition Tokens**: Develop scripts to match specified patterns using repetition tokens.
3. **Not Quite HBTN Yet**: Match a string that starts with 'h', ends with 'n', and has any single character in between.
4. **Call Me Maybe**: Match a 10 digit phone number.
5. **OMG WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING?**: Match strings that contain only capital letters.

## Resources
- **Rubular**: A Ruby-based regular expression editor, which is a helpful tool for testing regex patterns.
- **Learning Resources**: Links to resources for learning regular expressions are provided.
